1.This repository contains a classifier model trained with Car Evaluation Dataset(Source:[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/car-evaluation-data-set)).
2.The main challenge with the dataset is that most the features are categorical and we can't give these categorical features directly to a machine learning model.
3.We need to convert these categorical features first to train a machine learning model.
